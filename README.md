## 📖 Overview

**The Agentopia Times** is an educational game that teaches multi-agent system (MAS) design for hallucination mitigation through active experimentation. The game simulates a newsroom where LLM agents collaborate to create data-driven narratives, with users tasked to adjust communication protocols to manage hallucinated content.

### ✨ Key Features

- **Newsroom Simulation**: Experience how LLM agents collaborate in a familiar data journalism context
- **Interactive MAS Design**: Adjust communication protocols and coordination strategies to manage hallucinated content
- **Structured Learning**: Mapping between MAS concepts and familiar gameplay mechanics with immediate feedback
- **No Installation**: Runs directly in web browsers—play and learn online
- **Hallucination Exploration**: Understand propagation patterns and refine strategies through two use cases

> Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support data analysis and visualization tasks but remain prone to hallucinations and produce incorrect results. Recent work suggests that multi-agent systems (MAS) can mitigate hallucinations by enabling internal validation and cross-verification among diverse agents. However, designing effective MAS architectures is challenging, particularly for newcomers, due to the wide range of coordination strategies and a lack of interactive, hands-on learning tools. To address this, we present The Agentopia Times, an educational game that teaches MAS design for hallucination mitigation through active experimentation. The Agentopia Times simulates a newsroom where LLM agents collaborate to create data-driven narratives, with users tasked to adjust communication protocols to manage hallucinated content. The game features a structured mapping between MAS concepts and familiar gameplay mechanics, providing immediate feedback on agent performance and hallucination outcomes. Through two use cases, we demonstrate how The Agentopia Times enables users to explore hallucination propagation and refine MAS strategies.
